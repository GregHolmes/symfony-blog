# Webpack Encore: A Simple & Powerful Webpack API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/symfony/webpack-encore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/symfony/webpack-encore)

Webpack Encore is a simpler way to integrate [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) into your
application. It *wraps* Webpack, giving you a clean & powerful API
for bundling JavaScript modules, pre-processing CSS & JS and compiling
and minifying assets. Encore gives you professional asset system
that's a *delight* to use.

Encore is inspired by [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) and
[Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/mix), but stays in the spirit of
Webpack: using its features, concepts and naming conventions for a familiar
feel. It aims to solve the most common Webpack use cases.

> Encore is made by Symfony and works *beautifully* in Symfony applications.
> But it can easily be used in any application... in any language!
